# ‚úçÔ∏è MNIST Digit Classifier: Recognizing Handwritten Digits

Dive into the fascinating world of machine learning with the MNIST Digit Classifier. This project harnesses the power of deep learning to recognize and classify handwritten digits, ranging from 0Ô∏è‚É£ to 9Ô∏è‚É£. Using the iconic MNIST dataset, often dubbed the "Hello World" üåç of machine learning, our classifier serves as a testament to the potential of neural networks in pattern recognition tasks.
