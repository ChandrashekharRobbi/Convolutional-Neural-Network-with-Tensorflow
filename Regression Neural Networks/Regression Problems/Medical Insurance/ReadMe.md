# ü©∫ Medical Insurance Prediction

In this project, I've delved into the realm of medical insurance costs. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, my primary objective is to predict insurance charges based on specific parameters.

If the goal is to predict a numerical value, it's a **Regression Problem**, and that's precisely what I tackled here!

## üöÄ Project Breakdown:
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding & Preprocessing the Data

Gaining a deep understanding of the data is crucial. Not only does it shed light on the available parameters/features, but visualizations also provide richer insights.

I've optimized data preprocessing, employing the `pd.get_dummies()` method for one-hot encoding.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Crafting the Baseline Model

I embarked on the modeling journey with a baseline model, comprising just two dense layers. Always best to start simple and then refine!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluating the Model

Here, I assessed the model's prowess in learning patterns and its precision in predicting insurance charges. The chosen metric for evaluation? Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Refining & Improving the Model

A model can always be better! Some strategies I adopted include:
- Introducing additional layers.
- Experimenting with different activation functions.
- Adjusting the learning rate.

## üåê Future Directions:
I'm continuously seeking ways to enhance the model further. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable in this journey!
